                Ekcel Farms Limited (Ekcel Farms) is a wholly owned subsidiary
                of Oilserv Limited. The thought to diversify into the
                Agricultural sector of the economy was the brainchild of an
                astute entrepreneur and industrialist – Engr. (Sir) Emeka
                Okwuosa. The project is aimed at facilitating a massive
                agricultural revolution in Nigeria and the sub-region which in
                return foster an enormous economic transformation through
                employment generation, elimination of agricultural losses due to
                the current shortfall in processing facilities and encourage
                independent farming through an organised out-growers scheme.
                Ekcel Farms is positioned to be the largest tomato and cassava
                refinery plant in Africa. Its focus is on a large-scale
                (commercial) production of tomato & cassava and processing into
                various by-products for the local and export markets. This will
                consequently pave the way for the state through improved revenue
                generation. Our choice of tomato and cassava was determined by
                the domestic and international demands for the processed
                agro-allied products. We would focus on target markets where
                there are currently supply gaps due to the inability to meet the
                increasing demand. The agro-allied processing farmland is being
                set up to commence the local processing of cassava into starch
                and ethanol, and tomato into tomato paste and ketchup, for both
                domestic consumptions and export. The raw materials – tomato and
                cassava would be produced in the community. Our farming and
                production activities will be based on internationally
                recognised and accepted standards, and a very strong emphasis
                would be placed on product quality, development and control
                measures. Also, our operations will maximise the utilisation of
                local agricultural raw produce, and by so doing, create more
                jobs for citizens of immediate communities and put more money in
                their pockets. In the words of our Chairman/Chief Executive
                Officer, “We are not just here to farm but to set up an
                industrial processing and mechanized agricultural business. The
                whole aim is to cultivate, process and market cassava and tomato
                products. It is now clearly obvi¬ous that agriculture needs to
                be developed to become the bedrock of the Nigerian economy”. We
                are here to stay and for good.
